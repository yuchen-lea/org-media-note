* About
Take notes for video and audio files in org-mode! Now supported:

- both local and online medias are supported  (requires installing yt-dlp, see [[Online Video]]).
- media control: seek backward/forward, control volume and playback speed ...
- new link types =video=, =audio=
  + *Timestamp Link* e.g. =[[video:course.mp4#0:01:56][0:01:56]]=
    - =M-RET= will auto insert current timestamp during playing media, if point at a list starting with an org-media-note link (e.g., =- [[video:test.mp4#0:02:33][0:02:33]] note=).
    - click link to jump to corresponding position
  + *AB-Loop Link* e.g. =[[video:course.mp4#0:01:56-0:01:58][0:01:56-0:01:58]]=
    - insert this kind of link when playing in a A-B loop
    - click link to jump to point A, and auto loop between A and B
- When taking notes, you can quickly:
  + insert timestamps or ab-loop links for intervals
  + insert current screenshots or GIFs
  + insert current subtitles
  + merge multiple notes, which is suitable for organizing after importing subtitles.
- When inserting timestamps, you can customize:
  - Whether to automatically insert a screenshot of the current video.
  - Whether to automatically pause after inserting the timestamp.
- import from:
  - Subtitle files: SRT, VTT, ASS.
  - Chapter list of current playing file.
  - PBF: generated by PotPlayer
  - TXT: exported by [[https://www.notedapp.io/][Noted]]
  - [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Timers.html][Timers]]

Working with [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] to get a better experience:

- quick open related media file in org-ref note (file path is got from bib file)
- new link types =videocite=, =audiocite=
  + e.g. =[[videocite:key#0:01:56][0:01:56]]= or =[[videocite:key#0:01:56-0:01:58][0:01:56-0:01:58]]=
  + you can chose to insert =video= or =videocite= link
  + click link to jump to corresponding position, or start A-B loop
  + show bib info when pointing at link
  + open org-ref action list

* QuickStart
â„¹ Currently, you have to install this package from github.

- for doom usersï¼š
  1. Install
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el"
(package! org-media-note :recipe (:host github :repo "yuchen-lea/org-media-note"))
     #+END_SRC
  2. Config
     + don't use org-ref
       #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package! org-media-note
    :hook (org-mode .  org-media-note-mode)
    :bind (
           ("H-v" . org-media-note-hydra/body))  ;; Main entrance
    :config
    (setq org-media-note-screenshot-image-dir "~/Notes/imgs/")  ;; Folder to save screenshot
    )
       #+END_SRC
     + use org-ref
       #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package! org-media-note
    :init (setq org-media-note-use-org-ref t)
    :hook (org-mode .  org-media-note-mode)
    :bind (
           ("H-v" . org-media-note-hydra/body))  ;; Main entrance
    :config
    (setq org-media-note-screenshot-image-dir "~/Notes/imgs/")  ;; Folder to save screenshot
    (setq org-media-note-use-refcite-first t)  ;; use videocite link instead of video link if possible
    )
       #+END_SRC
- for non-doom users: You can
   1. Manually download org-media-note, include it in your =load-path=, then refers to the above config
   2. Or use quelpa-use-package (thanks [[https://github.com/japhir][japhir]] for kindly providing this snippet)
      #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package quelpa-use-package)  ;; to allow installation of github packages
(use-package org-media-note
  :quelpa (org-media-note :fetcher github :repo "yuchen-lea/org-media-note")
  :hook (org-mode .  org-media-note-mode)
  :bind (("H-v" . org-media-note-hydra/body))  ;; Main entrance
  :config
  (setq org-media-note-screenshot-image-dir "~/notes/imgs/"))
      #+END_SRC
   3. If manually loading org-media-note without a package manager like
      =package.el= or =straight=, you need to =(require 'org-media-note-org-ref)=.

Now, you can access all functions in =org-media-note-pretty-hydra/body= or =org-media-note-transient=.

â„¹ Here, I use Hyper key =H= for keybinding. In this way, I can quickly access personal functions, and no major or minor modes will stamp on my keys. Look into this for more information: [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_hyper_super_keys.html][Emacs: How to Bind Super Hyper Keys]]. Or you can bind it to any other key you like. After all, it's Emacs ;)
* Functions

All functions are accessible via =org-media-note-pretty-hydra/body= or =org-media-note-transient= (depending on the value of the =org-media-note-interface=):

- Headerï¼šDisplay basic info, file path, volume, duration and so on
- Fileï¼šFunctions about media file
  + =o= Conditionally open media file in mpv.  (=org-media-note-play-smart=) Priorities are as follows:
    1. When point at a file link, play it in mpv.
    2. When integrated with org-ref, calling this function in an org-ref note will open the media file described in bib entry.
       + Your media file will be auto opened if all of the following are true:
         - You're under an org-ref note, which means the =Custom_ID= stores the entry key.
         - Files can be found by =bibtex-completion-find-pdf=. You should keep the value of =bibtex-completion-pdf-field= and the field which store files consistent.
         - Your media file extension is included in =org-media-note--video-types= or =org-media-note--audio-types=
    3. When media files found in org-attach-dir, open this file if there's only one file, else, let user chose file from attach directory.

â„¹ Corresponding function is in the brackets. Those without brackets usually call mpv commands directly. More info refers =org-media-note-pretty-hydra=.

** transient ui

The transient interface has the same functions and key bindings as the pretty-hydra interface.

To accommodate a more compact layout, config commands are semantically grouped:

[[../demo/org-media-note-transient.png?raw=true]]

* Dependencies
- [[https://github.com/kljohann/mpv.el][mpv.el]] control media inside emacs
- Currently provides two frontends, customizable via =org-media-note-interface=:
  + [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] (default): Built into Emacs since version 28, displayed at the bottom of the current window.
  + [[https://github.com/jerrypnz/major-mode-hydra.el][pretty-hydra]]: create an amiable hydra, displayed at the bottom of the current frame.

 [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] is not required, but it's worth to have a try if you use bib to manage your media file!
** Online Video

Using org-media-note for online video notes relies on mpv's streaming feature and requires additional external dependencies:
- [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation][yt-dlp/yt-dlp: A youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes]]: Used for downloading website videos. [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md][List of supported websites]]. It is smoother and more powerful than youtube-dl, which is the default used by mpv. If you want to play online videos but haven't installed yt-dlp, org-media-note will raise an error.
- [[https://github.com/UlyssesZh/yt-dlp-danmaku/][UlyssesZh/yt-dlp-danmaku: yt-dlp plugin for converting Bilibili danmaku into ASS format]]: If you need to load Bilibili danmaku.

Settings can be applied in several places, with priority from low to high:

1. =mpv.conf= file: General settings for mpv.
2. =org-media-note-mpv-general-options= variable: General settings in org-media-note. The default value specifies using yt-dlp for downloads:
    #+begin_src ini
    --script-opts=ytdl_hook-ytdl_path=yt-dlp
    #+end_src
2. =org-media-note-mpv-online-website-options-alist= variable: Individual settings for websites, for example, Bilibili needs to download all subtitles and danmaku, while YouTube's auto-generated subtitles only need to download specific languages.

   - The default configuration will download Chinese and English subtitles for YouTube and load all subtitles together with danmaku for Bilibili. The subtitle feature for Bilibili requires loading cookies to obtain login information, please modify according to actual conditions, seeÂ [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp][FAQ Â· yt-dlp/yt-dlp Wiki]].

4. =org-media-note-mpv-webstream-download-path= variable: Download directory for online video subtitles and other files. Default is temporary folder. If set to nil, it will download to the current directory.

Configure general streaming settings. For example, specify using yt-dlp to download:
    #+begin_src ini
    script-opts=ytdl_hook-ytdl_path=yt-dlp
    #+end_src


As long as you can normally load subtitles in mpv, org-media-note can control playback, insert timestamps and screenshots, and even import subtitles just like with local media!

The following image demonstrates playing a Bilibili video, danmaku navigation, switching subtitles, importing subtitles, and other functions:
